# ‚ùÑ Nix Config

This folder contains the configuration for all my devices, handled through Nix.
Currently, there is only MacOS and it's still not complete (WIP).

## To-Do:

- [ ] Make Mac configuration more reproducible (declare all apps on config file)

- [ ] Add Nvim config

- [ ] Migrate NAS configuration to Flakes (with Disko)
